# The command line for Kaisin, a self-hosted application platform on Kubernetes.
#
# This is a tap rather than a formula in homebrew-core, which has a rule against software
# that cannot be built from public source. It lives in its own repository because Homebrew
# requires one: a tap is found by name, and the name is the repository's.
#
# The archives hang off releases on THIS repository, not on bluepawlabs/kaisin. Kaisin is
# private and Homebrew fetches with no credentials, so a url pointing there answers 404
# for everybody outside the organisation — which is to say, for everybody `brew install`
# is for.
#
#   brew install bluepawlabs/kaisin/kaisin
#
# Generated in full by the release that published the archives. Editing it by hand is how
# a formula ends up pointing at a version nobody is running.
